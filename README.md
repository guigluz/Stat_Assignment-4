## Spatial Analysis task

From a TIF file provided by MapBiomas (https://storage.googleapis.com/mapbiomas-public/brasil/collection-6/lclu/coverage/brasil_coverage_2020.tif), 
I extract data for the  state of Rio de Janeiro and analyze the forest coverage of different municipalities. 

The outputs are:

* a table presenting the top 10 municipalities in the rank of highest percentage of forest coverage 
* a map showing a colored scale for the forest coverage of the municipalities
